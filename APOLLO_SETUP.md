# ðŸš€ Quick Setup - Auto Email Finding with Apollo.io

## Step 1: Get Your Apollo.io API Key (FREE)

1. Go to https://app.apollo.io/
2. Sign up for a FREE account
3. Go to Settings â†’ Integrations â†’ API
4. Copy your API key

**Free Tier Includes:**
- 50 email lookups per month
- No credit card required

## Step 2: Add API Key to Your .env File

Open `/Users/pranavsrigiriraju/Documents/sourcing/.env` and replace:

```
APOLLO_API_KEY=your_apollo_api_key_here
```

With your actual key:

```
APOLLO_API_KEY=abc123xyz...
```

## Step 3: That's It!

Backend server has been restarted automatically. Now when you:

1. Visit a LinkedIn profile
2. Click "Add to Cadence"
3. **Email is AUTO-FILLED** âœ¨

No more manual entry!

## How It Works

1. Extension extracts: Name, Company, Domain from LinkedIn
2. Sends to your backend
3. Backend calls Apollo.io API
4. Apollo returns the email
5. Email field auto-populates!

## If Apollo Fails

- Shows **email pattern guesses** (first.last@company.com)
- You can edit/verify before submitting
- Still way faster than manual lookup!

## Testing Without Apollo

Even without an API key, the system will:
- Generate smart email pattern guesses
- Show multiple suggestions
- Let you pick the most likely one

## Upgrade Later

When you need more than 50 emails/month:
- Basic: $49/mo for 1,000 credits
- Professional: $99/mo for 3,000 credits
- Organization: $149/mo for 6,000 credits

Each email lookup = 1 credit
